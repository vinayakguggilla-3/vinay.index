    <h3>Telugu film </h3>

     <p>They Call Him OG was released worldwide in theatres on 25 September 2025, setting the biggest opening day in India in 2025 by grossing ₹155 crores worldwide on its opening day.[8] It received mixed reviews from critics, praising its cinematography, production values, Thaman's music, and Kalyan's screen presence, but criticizing the film's formulaic story, predictability, forced cliffhanger and lack of originality. Despite that, it still emerged as the ninth-highest grossing Indian film of 2025 and the highest grossing Telugu film of 2025.</p>

    <h3>Story</h3>

<p>In 1970s Japan, the Yakuza raid a Samurai dojo, massacring all but one student. The sole survivor, a young Ojas Gambheera 'OG', escapes and boards a ship on its way to Bombay. Also via that ship, Telugu and Marathi businessmen Satyanarayana 'Satya Dada' and Vardhaman Mirajkar are transporting a large cache of gold bars, with which they intend to build a private port in Colaba, Bombay. Onboard, Gambheera rescues Satya Dada and Mirajkar from a violent gang of thieves, killing them all with his katana. Later, Gambheera, impressed by Satya Dada's intentions to help people with his port, pledges fealty to him. Over the next few years, Satya Dada's port is established and thrives, in part thanks to the protection Gambheera offers. However, Mirajkar breaks his partnership with Satya Dada and intends to take over the port by any means necessary, becoming his fierce rival in the process.</p>

<p>Kushi (transl. Happiness) is a 2001 Indian Telugu-language romantic comedy film written and directed by S. J. Suryah and produced by A. M. Rathnam. The film stars Pawan Kalyan and Bhumika Chawla. The film was initially planned as a bilingual along with the Tamil version, but released a year later due to production delays.[3][4][5] The film features music composed by Mani Sharma. Pawan Kalyan also choreographed all the action sequences and directed three songs in the film.
Kushi was released on 27 April 2001 and became a blockbuster at the box office, emerging as the highest-grossing Telugu film at the time.[6][9] The film was critically acclaimed for its screenplay, music, cinematography and especially the performance of Pawan Kalyan.[6] Kushi was the culmination of a streak of six consecutive hits for Pawan Kalyan and his style, mannerisms and dialogues from the film were much imitated by the youth.[6]</p>
